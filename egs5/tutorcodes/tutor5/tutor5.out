 RAYLEIGH OPTION REQUESTED FOR MEDIUM NUMBER  1

 EGS SUCCESSFULLY 'HATCHED' FOR ONE MEDIUM.

 Knock-on electrons can be created and any electron followed down to
                                          0.010 MeV kinetic energy
 Brem photons can be created and any photon followed down to
                                          0.010 MeV

 For  50.0 keV photons incident on 0.5cm of H2O with PCUT=0.010 MeV

 Transmitted primaries=                   88.89%  ave energy=     0.050 MeV

 Fraction Rayleigh scattering=             0.95%  ave energy=     0.049 MeV

 Fraction Compton scattering only=         8.60%  ave energy=     0.046 MeV
